## Task B10: Remove Control-Related Code and Files

### Implementation Details

#### Key Files Modified

1. **Header Files**
   - `Utils/control_debug_states.hpp`: Commented out control-related methods
   - `Utils/Classes.hpp`: Removed control-related functionality
   - `ahrs_loc_handler.hpp`: Removed control interfaces

2. **Implementation Files**
   - `Utils/control_debug_states.cpp`: Commented out methods for debugging control states
   - `ahrs_loc_handler.cpp`: Removed control-related methods
   - `Main.cpp`: Commented out control test function calls

3. **Renamed/Deprecated Files**
   - Renamed `Controllers.cpp` → `Controllers.cpp.deprecated` 
   - Renamed `Controllers.hpp` → `Controllers.hpp.deprecated`
   - This prevents the Python binding's `GLOB_RECURSE` command from including these files

4. **Build System**
   - Updated `Utils/CMakeLists.txt`: Removed Controllers.cpp from source files list
   - Modified `Tests/python/python_binding/CMakeLists.txt`: Build works with localization-only code

### Challenges Addressed

1. **Python Binding Issues**: 
   - The Python binding build script was including all .cpp files regardless of CMake settings
   - Solution: Renamed files with .deprecated extension to exclude them from build

2. **Refactoring Control Debug States**:
   - Required careful commenting of control-related methods while preserving localization logging
   - Ensured proper function removal without breaking the remaining functionality

3. **Testing**:
   - Verified all localization functionality still works via the test_localization.sh script
   - All localization tests pass with expected position and orientation values

### Next Steps

- Consider creating proper abstractions between localization and control interfaces
- Further clean up deprecated code that is no longer used
- Improve Python testing framework with more comprehensive test cases
