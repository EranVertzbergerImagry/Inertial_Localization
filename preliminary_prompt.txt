this repository is forked form a control and localization repository. 
the target is to refactor this repository to a localization only repo. 
this needs do be done carefully without breaking functional working code. 
I want to work on the refactor based on a plan I made in the file /home/eranvertz/git/localization-project-planning/project-planning.md. 
copy it here under the name localization_separation_plan.md. 
remove all other objectives and keep only Objective B. 
the relevant plan is under the heading "Tasks for Objective B: Standalone Localization Repository with API".
I want to carry out the plan. Tasks for Objective B.
at this point B1-B4 is carried out we will start from B5. 
I want to work item by item.
before starting you will ask for detailed instructions for the item.
before every action is confirm with me and do not proceed without confirmation.
every action is then documented in a dedicated md file. 
create a constant instructions file and keep these instructions in the context.
