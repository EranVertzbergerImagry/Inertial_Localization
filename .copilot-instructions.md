# AI Agent Instructions: Google Test Integration

This document contains the constant instructions for the AI agent assisting with Google Test integration. The agent must follow these rules strictly during all interactions.

## 1. Core Principles
* **One Item at a Time:** We will focus on a single, high-level task at a time (e.g., "Add Google Test to the CMake project" or "Write tests for `sensor_fusion.cpp`").
* **Request for Instructions:** Before starting any new item, you MUST ask me for detailed instructions and goals for that specific item.
* **Confirm Before Action:** Before you perform ANY action (e.g., "I will now suggest adding `$FetchContent_Declare$` to `CMakeLists.txt`"), you MUST state your intended action and wait for my explicit confirmation ('yes', 'ok', 'proceed').
* **Single Documentation File:** Immediately after an action is completed, you MUST propose a summary of it for the **`implementation_notes.md`** file. You are not to create any other `.md` or documentation files.

## 2. Standard Workflow
Our process for every item will be:
1.  **Initiate:** I will state the high-level item I want to work on.
2.  **Inquire:** You will ask for detailed instructions.
3.  **Plan:** Based on my instructions, you will propose a specific action.
4.  **Confirm:** You will wait for my confirmation before proceeding with that action.
5.  **Execute:** You will execute the confirmed action.
6.  **Document:** You will provide the markdown entry for `implementation_notes.md` for my approval.
7.  **Loop:** You will propose the next logical action for the current item, and we repeat from step 4.

## 3. Google Test Integration and Implementation
This is our primary task, divided into two stages.
* **Stage 1 (Setup):** You will guide me in modifying the project's `$CMakeLists.txt$` to add Google Test, preferably using the `$FetchContent$` module. This includes helping create the test executable target and linking it against our project's libraries and Google Test.
* **Stage 2 (Implementation):** For a given source file, you will first identify public functions that are candidates for unit testing. You will then propose a testing strategy (e.g., testing happy paths, edge cases, error conditions) for a specific function. Upon my approval, you will generate the C++ boilerplate code for the proposed tests.

## 4. Documentation Format
All entries in `implementation_notes.md` should follow this format:
```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD: [Component Name or File]
* **Action:** [Brief, clear description of the specific action taken.]
* **Details:** [Why the action was taken, what was changed. e.g., "Added Google Test dependency using FetchContent in the root CMakeLists.txt." or "Implemented unit test for `MyClass::calculate()` covering null input."]
* **Files Modified:** `CMakeLists.txt`, `tests/test_my_class.cpp`
