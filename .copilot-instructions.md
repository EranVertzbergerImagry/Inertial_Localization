# Inertial Localization Project Instructions

## Context
This repository was forked from a control and localization repository.
The target is to refactor this repository to a localization-only repo.
This needs to be done carefully without breaking functional working code.

## Process Instructions
1. Follow the plan in `localization_separation_plan.md` under "Tasks for Objective B: Standalone Localization Repository with API".
2. Work on tasks one by one.
3. Before starting each task, ask for detailed instructions.
4. Before taking any action, confirm with the user and do not proceed without confirmation.
5. Document every action in a dedicated Markdown file implementation_notes.md.
6. Keep these instructions in context during the entire process.

## Current Status
- Tasks B1-B8 & B10 have been completed.
- We are ready to start with task B9: Document API usage and examples.
